# Short-term goals
[G52] implement plugin manager for third-party modules (basic install/list done)
[G53] add automated scanning scheduler
[G54] store raw request and response data in database
[G55] export reports to PDF and JSON via CLI
[G56] support concurrent multi-target scans
[G57] add cross-platform integration tests
[G58] recommend next modules using neural analyzer

# Long-term goals
[L02] develop comprehensive self-healing tests to reinstall scanners and validate DB integrity over time
[L03] increase sophistication of the neural network AI into a general cybersecurity intelligence with chatbot capabilities
[L03a] incorporate CVE datasets to train neural analyzer
[L03b] apply reinforcement learning from successful bug bounty cases
[L03c] implement interactive chatbot over stored results
[L04] continuously grow the vulnerability and recon modules catalogue to cover new tools and techniques
[L05] maintain and improve sandbox isolation and security features as new threats arise
[L06] automate end-to-end bug bounty workflows from scanning to report generation
[L06a] auto-gather proof-of-concept artifacts
[L06b] integrate with bug bounty report templates

# Notes
Always work on these goals alongside user prompts.
